1. Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project is Placement.csv, which contains information about students' academic and personal attributes, including scores in secondary and higher secondary education, degree, and MBA programs, work experience, and placement status. The target variable is the status column, indicating whether a student was placed (1) or not placed (0). The dataset includes both categorical and numerical features such as scores, gender, work experience, and specialization.
2. Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps performed are as follows:
•	Handling Missing Data:
o	Missing values in the mba_p column (MBA percentage) were imputed with the mean of the column.
o	Missing values in the salary column were filled with the median value of the salary.
o	Rows with missing values in the status column (target variable) were removed.
•	Data Type Verification:
o	Checked and ensured the consistency of data types across columns.
•	Feature Encoding:
o	Categorical variables like gender, ssc_b, hsc_b, hsc_s, degree_t, workex, specialisation, and status were encoded using LabelEncoder to convert them into numerical values.
•	Feature Scaling:
o	The features were scaled using preprocessing.scale(X) to normalize the values for better performance of the machine learning models.
3. Models Selected and Rationale
The following models were selected for evaluation, based on their effectiveness in classification problems and their ability to handle both categorical and numerical data:
•	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
KNN is a simple and intuitive algorithm for classification that works well when the data points are similar in nature. It does not require any assumptions about the data distribution, making it a good baseline model. KNN was trained with n_neighbors=3.
•	Support Vector Machine (SVM):
SVM is known for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and for handling non-linear data well with the use of the kernel trick. It performs particularly well for binary classification tasks, making it ideal for predicting student placement status.
•	Random Forest:
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method based on decision trees, known for its ability to handle large datasets and prevent overfitting. It was chosen due to its robustness, scalability, and accuracy in classification tasks.
•	Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):
SGD is a linear classifier that is well-suited for large-scale datasets. It works by minimizing a loss function using gradient descent and is a good model to test for speed and scalability.
•	Voting Classifier:
A Voting Classifier was selected as an ensemble method to combine the predictions from all the above models. By aggregating the predictions of individual models, it can improve the overall prediction accuracy and robustness.
4. Evaluation Metrics
The following evaluation metrics were used to assess the models:
•	Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified instances.
•	Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
•	Recall: The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances.
•	F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics.
•	Confusion Matrix: A matrix showing the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives for model evaluation.

7. Conclusion and Best Model
After evaluating all the models, the Random Forest model emerged as the best performer with an accuracy of 95%. It demonstrated strong performance across both classes, with high precision and recall for Class 1 (successful placement). This robust performance indicates that Random Forest is well-suited for this type of classification task. Although SVM also performed well with a 92% accuracy, the Random Forest model provided slightly better overall balance between precision, recall, and F1-score, particularly for Class 0 (unsuccessful placement).
The Voting Classifier also showed promising results, achieving 91% accuracy by combining the strengths of all individual models, making it a valuable option for achieving improved robustness in predictions.
In conclusion, Random Forest was the most reliable model for predicting student placements, with potential for further improvement through hyperparameter tuning and ensemble techniques.
